Sample Code file is a simple example of the code for this project which contains brief comments. Because of the high degree of modularity of the code in this article, simply replacing the data set will give the other results shown in the article.

The complete code and dataset are in the file with same name.

The complete code file is divided into two parts, the EMD-CAE is the model proposed in this project, and the MA-CAE is code reproduced from the key reference. We reproduce this MA-CAE model for better comparison and show the improvements in the EMD-CAE model.

In the EMD-CAE file, there are three sub-files: daily(nine small data), bitcoin(1-minute) and traffic(20-minute). Each of them has in-sample and out-of-sample tests. Moreover, there is a further proof file in the daily file. These files contain all the results mentioned in the paper.

In the MA-CAE file, there are the same structure like in the EMD-CAE file.
